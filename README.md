# NeuroXiv

NeuroXiv is an advanced platform for the centralized, atlas-oriented management and dynamic mining of brain-wide neuron morphometry. It provides a comprehensive database, visualization tools, and machine learning pipelines for brain research. The platform integrates multiple components, including backend APIs, frontend interfaces, and VTK-based rendering systems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

- **backend/**: Contains the Flask-based backend API that handles data processing, database interactions, and other server-side logic.
- **frontend/**: Contains the Vue.js-based frontend interface, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the NeuroXiv platform.
- **VTK/**: Contains VTK (Visualization Toolkit) files and configurations for 3D rendering of brain regions and neuron reconstructions.

Additionally, there are some important files in the root directory:

- **LICENSE**: MIT License for the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the entire project.
